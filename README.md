React app bundle is preserved (`assets/index-CxleVYPI.js`). Enhancements (OpenInfraMap overlay, Live Grid, About sources, nav) load via `assets/siteline-enhance.js` and `assets/maplibre-siteline-hook.js`.

Worker `siteline-map` serves assets and proxies `/api/kardashev/*` and `/api/caiso/*` for browser CORS.
